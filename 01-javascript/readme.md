# Getting started
Make sure you have a terminal scoped to the `01-javascript` dierectory and then run `npm install`. This will walk through the package.json file and install all of the dependencies for this tutorial.

## Running the starting point
To view the starting point code in a browser you can run the command `npm run start` or `npm start`. This should automatically open a browser window with the code located in the `/start` directory.

If you decide to change the files in the start directory this will automatically refresh your browser.

## Running the end point
To view the final output of this tutorial run `npm run end` which will automatically open a browser widnow with the code located in the `/end` directory. Again saving these files will automatically update the browser.
